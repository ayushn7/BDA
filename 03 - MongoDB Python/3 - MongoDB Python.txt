# Step 1 : # Install mongodb by executing the installation file "mongodb-windows-x86_64-4.4.6-signed"
           # click next, next and finish the installation

# Step2 : Launch MongoDB
# Navigate to the following location : "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin"

#Start mongo daemon - 
mongod

#start mongo service - 
mongo

# Creating Collections and Documents

A MongoDB database is a physical container for collections of documents. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. These files are managed by the MongoDB server, which can handle several databases.

In MongoDB, a collection is a group of documents. Collections are somewhat analogous to tables in a traditional RDBMS, but without imposing a rigid schema. In theory, each document in a collection can have a completely different structure or set of fields.


# Show list of db
show dbs

# Show current db
db

# create/switch to a db - use dbname
use udit

# display existing collections
show collections;

# create collection - db.collectionname
db.subjects

#insert into collection
db.subjects.insert({"name":"bda"})
db.subjects.insert({"name":"mn"})
db.subjects.insert({"name":"ip"})
db.subjects.insert({"name":"msa"})
show collections;

# Display all records in collection
db.subjects.find();

# Display specific record in colleciton
db.subjects.find({"name": "bda"});

# Using MongoDB With Python and PyMongo
# Install python 3.7.4
# Launch IDLE 3.7


# Installing PyMongo
# MongoDB provides an official Python driver called PyMongo.
python -m pip install pymongo

# start a Python interactive session and run the following import:
import pymongo

#Working With Databases, Collections
# Program 1: Creating a Database
from pymongo import MongoClient              
myclient = MongoClient()                                    //create a client object to communicate with running MongoDB instance
myclient				                    //test client

#to provide a custom host and port when you need to provide a host and port that differ from MongoDBâ€™s default
myclient = MongoClient(host="localhost", port=27017)

# chk db list
print(myclient.list_database_names())

#define which database you want to use
db = myclient["udit"]
